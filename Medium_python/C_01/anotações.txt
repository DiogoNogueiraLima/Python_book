By default, instances of user-defined classes are considered true, unless `bool` or `len` is implemented. Essentially, `bool(x)` calls `x.bool()` and uses the result. If `bool` is not implemented, Python tries to invoke `x.len()`, and if that returns zero, `bool` returns False. Otherwise, `bool` returns True.

What does ABC mean? Abstract Base Classes.

To instantiate a class means to create a specific object (an instance) of that class.

How is it possible to return a different order from the insertion order in Python 3.6 when iterating over a dictionary?

He gives the list of special methods, do I need to study the table or just have a brief overview without researching anything (page 46)?

I didn't understand the question about `add` and `radd` (Reversed arithmetic).

"Python inherited from ABC the uniform treatment of sequences. Strings, lists, byte sequences, arrays, XML elements, and database results share a rich set of common operations, including iteration, slicing, sorting, and concatenation." How is it in other languages?
