A container sequence maintains references to the objects it contains, which can be of any type, while a flat sequence stores the value of its content in its own memory space, not as distinct Python objects.
In other words, the memory space that would be for an object in a list is used to store the actual memory address of the list item's value.

Common tuples are considered flat sequences, but if there's a tuple within a tuple, it becomes a container sequence.

Regarding your final question on page 53, I searched the internet, but I'm not sure what headers those are.
